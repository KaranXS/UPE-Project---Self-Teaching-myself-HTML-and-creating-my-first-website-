        <h1> Karan's Website </h1>
        <h2> Test 1, 2, 3</h2>
        <h3> Test 1, 2, 3 </h3>
        <h4> Test 1, 2, 3 </h4>
        <h5> Test 1, 2, 3 </h5>
        <h6> Test 1, 2, 3 </h6>

        <b> Hey!!!! </b> <br><br>
        
       Here's the first website I'm making after self-studying HTML! It's kinda awesome. 

        <p>
           Here's a paragraph. Well technically it's just three sentences, but you get what I mean. 
           It's in an html paragraph tag :D. 

        </p>

         <p> Ever hear of line breaking? It's like /n but different. Actually it's exactly the same. Here's how you line break in HTML! Watch! <br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br> See, that wasn't so bad was it?</p> <br> Okay 
            that was like 8 line breaks but I wanted it to be really visible.

        <p>
            Check out these style tags I learned how to use!!! <br> <br>
            <b>This sentence is in bold!</b> <br>
            <i>This one is italicized! </i> <br>
            <u> This one is underlined! </u> <br>
            <em> This one has emphasis? </em> <br>
           <strong> This one's strong!!! </strong> <br>
           Oh man these sure are cool! I sure hope these won't become completely redundant once I learn CSS. <br> <br>


           Now I'm gonna make a line across the page. It's called a horizontal rule!
           <hr>

           <b> Sick. </b>

             I'm gonna link you to a picture of a cat! <a href ="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/adorable-meowing-tabby-kitten-outdoors-600nw-116218768.jpg"> Here. </a> 
             This link will open on the same page! Here's another that opens to a different page! <a href ="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/04/40/06/360_F_104400672_zCaPIFbYT1dXdzN85jso7NV8M6uwpKtf.jpg" target = "_blank"> Here! </a> 
             If everything goes well, I should be getting a cat soon. I'm pretty excited for that too to be honest. 
        </p>

        Alright now here's an image of a cat embedded in the website itself!
        <br>
        <img src ="http://placekitten.com/600/300" border = "10"> <br> <br>

        Let's mess a little with lists <br>
        <p>
        Types of animals: 

        <ul>
            <li> Dogs </li>
            <li> Cats </li>
            <li> Mice </li>
            <li> Birds </li>
            <li> Dinosaurs </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li> Dogs </li>
            <li> Cats </li>
            <li> Mice </li>
            <li> Birds </li>
            <li> Dinosaurs </li>
        </ol>

        I'm starting to think I might've leaned too hard into the cats bit it's not really all that funny anymore 

        <ul>
            <li> Dogs</li>
            <li> Cats </li>
            <ul> 
                <li> Abyssinian </li>
                <li> Pomerianian? </li>
                <li> I don't know a third :[ </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Mice </li>
            <li> Birds </li>
            <li> Dinosaurs </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        Okay, let's make a table entailing how much this cat is gonna cost us <br> <br>

        <p> Nice. I didn't really think this one through to be honest, I'm not sure I can afford a cat. I've also realized that I've probably gotta commit to the cat shtick for the rest of this prooject. Damn. </p>

        Here's audio of a cat meowing! <br>
        <audio controls src="Cat-voice-sound.mp3"></audio> <br><br>

        Here's audio of me meowing! I think mine sounds more believable to be honest. I bet you didn't realize that it had been looping in the background! I muted it :D. <br><br>
        <audio controls autoplay muted loop src="Me-meowing.mp3"></audio>
        <br>
        <br>
        Nvm I guess it wasn't looping in the background, something something, google chrome won't allow this or something. Aww man. Well at the very least, it still loops when you click on it!
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Okay here's a video of a cat. I can't even think of something funny to say. I just wanna go to bed man. <br><br>
        <video controls src="helpme.mp4" width="500"></video>

        <br> <br>

        Okay now I'm just gonna be writing "Cat" in several different colors, to prove I learned how or something. Idek anymore T_T. 

        <br> <br>

        <h1 style ="color :red"> Cat </h1> <br>
        <h1 style ="color :blue"> Cat </h1> <br>
        <h1 style ="color :turquoise"> Cat </h1> <br> 


        Oh now way they have turquoise that's actually so based and real. (It's 8am and I have an exam in 3 hours). <br>

        <h1 style ="color :turquoise"> Cat </h1> <br> 
        <h1 style ="color :cyan"> Cat </h1> <br>
        <h1 style ="color :aquamarine"> Cat </h1> <br>
        <h1 style ="color :teal"> Cat </h1> <br>

        These are turquoise, aquamarine, cyan, and teal. Your job is to tell me which is which.


       <p style="background-color: rebeccapurple; color: yellow"> Look guys I changed the background and text color!!! Oh man I just came back from that test.
    We're not gonna talk about it. <br> <br> Well, that's about everything! Thanks for visiting my website! And by that I mean thanks for downloading the files from my github repository,
    runnning them in vscode, and then opening them in chrome because I definitely didn't deploy this lmao.  </p>
