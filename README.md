# UPE-Project---Self-Teaching-myself-HTML-and-creating-my-first-website-
Hey! THis is my project, I taught myself HTML, and created a website. I made sure to incorporate everything that I learned such as lists, horizontal rules, tables, colors, etc. etc. 
To run it, all you have to do is open the files in VSCode, go to the file named MyWebsite.html, right-click, and hit open in default browser. Thanks for checking out my project!
